In list slicing, I used the range function to generate numbers from 1 to 10. Then, I created another list that contains only the first five numbers from this range and applied the slicing  [::-1] to reverse the order of these numbers.
In Dictionary of Student Marks I have used the Try, Except method and set for key value pairs for student marks.
